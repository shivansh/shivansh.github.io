This weekend I had planned to integrate Google Analytics with the blog.
However, thanks to my past self I had already done that sometime
back.
What caught my attention on the Google Analytics dashboard was unusually high
traffic on one of the old [posts](https://shivansh.github.io/posts/2016-05-13-window-size-and-mss) from 2016. This
indicated that people were able to find the post via Google, and sure enough the
query ["window size vs mss"](https://www.google.com/search?q=window+size+vs+mss) lists this blog 
second in the search results.

I'm glad to know that others have found a piece of this blog useful, and this
will motivate me to write more in the future.
