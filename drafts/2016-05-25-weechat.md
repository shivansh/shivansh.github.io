<br>

I have been procrastinating for writing this one since a very long time but here it is.

It has been long time since I have been using a GUI based IRC client, namely XChat. It is pretty good with most of the functionality needed, but I have come to realise that I am more of a CLI loving person. So if you are like me, you will love what I have recently come across -- Weechat. It is the awesomest IRC client I have ever seen (I accept I haven't seen too many :P). It appears as alien in the beginning, and documentation feels like crazy, but believe me, once you get the hang of it, you are going to love it. It might take some time.

So, we have now weechat installed (you can figure the installation part out), and you have your console open. The commands are pretty much the same as any other IRC client.

### Connecting to a server
Say you want to connect to irc.freenode.net, execute the following command - <br>
```
/connect irc.freenode.net
```
Changing nickname is also easy -
`/nick your-nickname`

### Joining a channel
For the most of the commands, you can simply use autocomplete by typing / and then pressing tab until you find the command of your choice.
`/join #channel`
Voila, you have joined a channel now. Note that the interface looks pretty much like any other GUI based client. The problem arises when you try to navigate.

* To scroll the title bar (the top-most bar) use F9.
