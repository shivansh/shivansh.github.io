Another GSoC over, a whole new set of skills acquired.

I would like to thank my mentors Brooks Davis, Alan Somers and Ngie Cooper for their guidance and friendly help during the entire duration. I was lucky to have such great mentors.

I won't be able to participate in GSoC anymore (cannot do it [more than twice](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation)), but I guess I enjoyed the past two to my heart's content.  
Long road ahead...
