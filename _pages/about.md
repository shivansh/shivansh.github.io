Hi. I am Shivansh Rai, a sophomore at department of Mathematics and Scientific Computing, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. 

I love pretty much anything related to a computer, well till now I have had my interests in Networks, System architecture, languages, Security, and most of all - Linux. I am yet to complete my <a href="http://www.wisdomgroup.com/blog/10000-hours-of-practice/" target="_blank">10,000 hours</a> to perfection, in a hope that I don't get distracted in between &#x1F60B; . I started working on a Linux (Ubuntu) OS on my machine when mistakenly I had my Windows partition corrupted while playing around. My initial thoughts on shifting completely on a Linux based OS were not good, but then I had no choice. Eventually on working for some time (about 7 months now), I realised that I am more happy than ever. My favourite passtime has been discovering new stuff related to Linux since then, and open source of course which exposed me to a lot of new fields.  

I made this blog in a hope to share some of the interesting stuff which I come across, and also for some happy memories. &#x1F601; 

Enjoy my posts and I hope to read your comments and feedback!
