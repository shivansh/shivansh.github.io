Hello!<br>
By way of introduction, I am Shivansh Rai. I'm currently a Member of Technical Staff at [Devrev](http://devrev.ai). In my previous life, I was an undergrad at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/) where I majored in Mathematics and Scientific Computing and minored in Computer Systems.

Growing up, I was a pretty whimsical kid. Until high school, I had explored and given up on writing poems and detective novels, calligraphy, painting, and pencil sketching. At some point, unsure how, I had a whim to write a computer program that could display shapes moving across the screen. A few Google searches I did at the time weren’t enough, and I gave up…until the first semester of college arrived. My introductory course on programming provided sufficient context, and I took the first opportunity to write my first game - [breakout](https://github.com/shivansh/breakout). This project opened several domains in Computer Science for me to explore, marking the beginning of my venture.

I am a computer programmer who believes that programs and algorithms can be beautiful.

In my free time, I usually read, occasionally play a guitar, and up until the pandemic used to trek frequently.

I made this blog to share some of the interesting stuff I come across and for some nostalgia down the road.
