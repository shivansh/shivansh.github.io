> It’s not magic, it’s talent and sweat.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; -- [Bertram Gilfoyle (Silicon Valley)](https://youtu.be/2-OQhot_ml0){:target="_blank"}

Howdy!<br>
By way of introduction, I am Shivansh Rai, a fourth year undergraduate majoring in the department of Mathematics and Scientific Computing, [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}.

I love pretty much anything related to a computer! Well, specifically I am a systems and networks enthusiast. Till now I have had my interests in operating systems (current favourite), computer networks, programming languages, algorithms, security, formal verification techniques, web development technologies and most of all - exploring ~~Linux~~ Linux and Unix. **<u>Update</u> :** _I am now attempting to make a transition to purely UNIX based systems after enjoying 4 months of GSoC'16 with FreeBSD_. I am yet to complete my [10,000 hours](http://www.wisdomgroup.com/blog/10000-hours-of-practice/){:target="_blank"} to perfection, in a hope that I don't get distracted in between (has been working out fine until now!). I started working on a Linux based OS on my machine when mistakenly I had my Windows partition corrupted while playing around. I was initially skeptical on making this transition as I had this thought that it wasn't possible to do as much stuff with a shell as compared to a GUI (hah!). Eventually after working for some time (more than 2 years now), I realised that I am more happy than ever and exploring my system was never this much fun. One of my favourite passtime since then has been discovering new stuff related to Linux/Unix (mostly the underlying lower layers), and open source of course which exposed me to a lot of new fields (and still exploring...).

When I'm not staring at my screen, I usually read.  
As for my work and open source contributions, it's all in [Github](https://github.com/shivansh){:target="_blank"}.

I made this blog in a hope to share some of the interesting stuff which I come across, and also for some happy memories. &#x1F601;

Enjoy my posts and I hope to read your comments and feedback!
