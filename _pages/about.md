Howdy!<br>
By way of introduction, I am Shivansh Rai. I'm currently working on the [SAP Cloud Platform](https://cloudplatform.sap.com/index.html). In a previous life, I was an undergrad at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/) where I majored in Mathematics and Scientific Computing and minored in Computer Systems.

I am a computer programmer, and I believe that programs and algorithms can be beautiful. I am yet to complete my [10,000 hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)){:target="_blank"} to perfection, hoping I don't get distracted en route.

I started working on a Linux based OS back in 2015 when mistakenly I had my Windows partition corrupted while playing around. I was initially skeptical about this transition since I thought absence of a GUI might be limiting. Eventually after working for some time, I realized that I enjoyed finding new things about my system while trying to make things work. This, marked the beginning of my journey into exploring various domains of Computer Science.

I like trekking, and had covered all the major trekking locations around Bangalore in the 6 months I got to stay there before the pandemic began. I also play an acoustic guitar.

I made this blog in a hope to share some of the interesting stuff which I come across, and for some nostalgia down the road.
