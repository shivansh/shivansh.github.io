> It’s not magic, it’s talent and sweat.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; -- [Bertram Gilfoyle (Silicon Valley)](https://youtu.be/2-OQhot_ml0){:target="_blank"}

Howdy!<br>
By way of introduction, I am Shivansh Rai. I'm currently a software developer
working on the [SAP Cloud Platform](https://cloudplatform.sap.com/index.html).
In a previous life, I was an undergrad at [Indian Institute of Technology
Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/) where I majored in Mathematics and Scientific
Computing and minored in Computer Systems.

I love pretty much anything related to a computer! Well, specifically I am a systems and networks enthusiast with a recently developed interest in Machine Learning. I am yet to complete my [10,000 hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)){:target="_blank"} to perfection, in the hope that I don't get distracted in between. I started working on a Linux based OS on my machine when mistakenly I had my Windows partition corrupted while playing around. I was initially skeptical about making this transition as I had this thought that it wasn't possible to do as much stuff with a shell as compared to a GUI (hah!). Eventually, after working for some time, I realized that I am happier than ever and exploring my system was never this much fun. One of my favorite pass time since then has been discovering new stuff related to Linux/Unix - mostly the underlying lower layers, and open source of course which exposed me to a lot of new fields (and am still exploring...).

When I'm not staring at my laptop screen, I usually
read.  As for
my work and open source contributions, it's all in
[Github](https://github.com/shivansh){:target="_blank"}.

I made this blog in a hope to share some of the interesting stuff which I come
across, and also for some happy memories. &#x1F601;

Enjoy my posts and I hope to read your comments and feedback!
