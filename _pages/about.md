By way of introduction, I am Shivansh Rai, a junior at the department of Mathematics and Scientific Computing, [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}.

I love pretty much anything related to a computer, well, specifically I am a systems and networks enthusiast. Till now I have had my interests in computer networks, system architecture, programming languages, computer systems security, formal verification techniques (current favourite), web development technologies ~~and most of all - Linux~~ **<u>Update</u> :** _I am now attempting to make a transition to purely UNIX based systems after enjoying 4 months of GSoC with FreeBSD_. I am yet to complete my [10,000 hours](http://www.wisdomgroup.com/blog/10000-hours-of-practice/){:target="_blank"} to perfection, in a hope that I don't get distracted in between &#x1F60B; . I started working on a Linux (Ubuntu) OS on my machine when mistakenly I had my Windows partition corrupted while playing around. My initial thoughts on shifting completely on a Linux based OS were not good, but then I had no choice. Eventually on working for some time (more than a year now), I realised that I am more happy than ever and that exploring my system is lot more fun. My favourite passtime since then has been discovering new stuff related to Linux (mostly low level stuff close to the system), and open source of course which exposed me to a lot of new fields (and still exploring...).

On finding time apart from projects, wargames and CTFs, I usually hang out on IRC.

As for my work and open source contributions, its all in [Github](https://github.com/shivrai){:target="_blank"}.

I made this blog in a hope to share some of the interesting stuff which I come across, and also for some happy memories. &#x1F601;

Enjoy my posts and I hope to read your comments and feedback!
