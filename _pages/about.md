Hello!<br>
By way of introduction, I am Shivansh Rai. I'm currently a Member of Technical Staff at [Devrev](http://devrev.ai). In a previous life, I was an undergrad at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/) where I majored in Mathematics and Scientific Computing and minored in Computer Systems.

I am a computer programmer, and I believe that programs and algorithms can be beautiful. I am yet to complete my [10,000 hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)){:target="_blank"} to perfection, hoping I don't get distracted en route.

As far as I can remember, I used to be a pretty whimsical kid. Up until high school I had explored (and given up on) writing poems and detective novels, calligraphy, painting and pencil sketching. At some point, not sure how, I had a whim of writing a computer program which could display shapes moving across the screen. A few google searches I did at the time weren't enough, and I gave up...until the first semester of college arrived. My introductory course on programming provided sufficient context, and I took the first opportunity to write my first game - [breakout](https://github.com/shivansh/breakout). This side project ended up opening several domains in Computer Science for me to explore, and marked the beginning of my venture.

In my free time I usually play an acoustic guitar, occassionally read and up until the pandemic used to go on treks.

I made this blog in a hope to share some of the interesting stuff which I come across, and for some nostalgia down the road.
